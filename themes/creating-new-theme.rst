New Themes in Incubation
------------------------
Lex Li has `a few blog posts <https://blog.lextudio.com/category/dockpanel-suite/>`_ on theming when he attempted to integrate the VS 2012 Light theme to the code base, which might get you started.

The following themes are currently under development (mainly contributed by community members),

* VS 2013 Blue (in vs2013blue branch for incubation, see #316 for progress)

* VS 2012 Dark (in various forks by different authors, see #317 for details)
